                Artificial intelligence(AI) refers to the stimulation of human intelligence and machines,
                AI enables machines to act like human intelligence
                Artificial Intelligence (AI) is machine-displayed intelligence that simulates human behavior or thinking and can be trained to solve specific problems. 
                AI is a combination of Machine Learning techniques and Deep Learning.
                Types of Artificial Intelligence models are trained using vast volumes of data and can make intelligent decisions.
                <b>Letâ€™s now take a look at how the application of AI is used in different domains.</b>

                <h2> AI in HealthCare </h2>
                <p>One of the critical AI applications is its integration with the healthcare and medical field.
                    AI transforms healthcare by improving diagnostics, personalizing treatment plans, and optimizing patient care.
                    AI algorithms can analyze medical images, predict disease outbreaks, and assist in drug discovery, enhancing the overall quality of healthcare services.

                    Example
                    IBM Watson Health uses AI to analyze vast amounts of medical data, assisting doctors in diagnosing diseases and recommending personalized treatment plans.</p>

                <h2> Facial Recognition </h2>
                <p>Face recognition technology uses AI to identify and verify individuals based on facial features.
                    This technology is widely used in security systems, access control, and personal device authentication, providing a convenient and secure way to confirm identity.

                    Example
                    Apple's Face ID technology uses face recognition to unlock iPhones and authorize payments, offering a secure and user-friendly authentication method.</p>
